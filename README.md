# Arrays & Loops Task

## Instructions

#### The Files

**Fork** this repository and clone your fork (make sure you clone it into your `development` directory):

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/JSFoundations-Arrays-Loops.git
```

#### Running Your Code

To run the code you're writing without running the automated tests, call the function you'd like to test manually in `funcions.js` and run the following command:

```bash
$ node arrayFunctions.js
```

#### Running The Tests

Install all the requirements:

1. Navigate to the project root (you'll find a file called `package.json` there).
2. Install the required packages with the following command:

   ```bash
   $ yarn install
   ```

Run the tests:

```bash
$ yarn test
```

This command will run the testing file and test your code to make sure it has all the required features.

You'll know when you're done when your code passes all the tests.
